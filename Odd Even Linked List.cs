//Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

//The first node is considered odd, and the second node is even, and so on.

//Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

//You must solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) time complexity.



//Example 1:

//Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
//Output: [1,3,5,2,4]

//Example 2:

//Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
//Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]



//Constraints:

//    The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range [0, 104].
//    -106 <= Node.val <= 106
